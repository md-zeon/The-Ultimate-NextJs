## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your computer. These are essential tools for running the project.

### 1. Node.js
- **What it is:** Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. This project uses it to run Next.js.
- **Version Required:** 18 or higher.
- **How to Install:**
  - Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
  - Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
  - Run the installer and follow the prompts.
  - Verify installation: Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:
    ```
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```
    You should see version numbers (e.g., v20.x.x for Node, 10.x.x for npm).

**Note for Beginners:** npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js. It's used to install project dependencies.

### 2. Git
- **What it is:** Git is a version control system to clone the project code from GitHub or similar.
- **How to Install:**
  - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).
  - Install and verify: `git --version`.
- If you don't have the repo URL, you can download it as a ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

### 3. Code Editor (Recommended: VS Code)
- **What it is:** A text editor for writing and editing code.
- **How to Install:** Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) from the official site.
- **Extensions for Beginners:**
  - Install "ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets" for faster coding.
  - "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" for styling help.
  - "Thunder Client" to test API endpoints easily.

### 4. MongoDB Account
- **What it is:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database to store user data and todos.
- **We'll set this up in Step 4.**

**Tip:** If you're on Windows, use Command Prompt or PowerShell. On macOS/Linux, use the built-in Terminal.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to where you want to store the project (e.g., Desktop):
   ```
   cd Desktop
   ```
3. Clone the project (replace `<repo-url>` with the actual GitHub URL if available; otherwise, download ZIP):
   ```
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
   Or, if no repo: Download ZIP from GitHub, extract to `Nexen-Next-Basics` folder.
4. Enter the project directory:
   ```
   cd Nexen-Next-Basics
   ```

**What this does:** This copies all the project files to your computer.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Dependencies are libraries the project needs (listed in `package.json`).

1. In the terminal, inside the project folder, run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   - This downloads and installs packages like Next.js, React, MongoDB driver, etc., into a `node_modules/` folder.
   - It may take a few minutes. You'll see progress in the terminal.

**For Beginners:** If you get errors like "permission denied," try running as administrator (right-click Command Prompt > Run as administrator on Windows).

**Additional Installs (if not already in package.json):**
- MongoDB: `npm install mongodb`
- Types: `npm install --save-dev @types/mongodb`

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Environment variables store sensitive info like database URLs securely.

1. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory (same level as `package.json`).
   - In VS Code: Right-click in explorer > New File > `.env.local`.
2. Add the following line (replace with your actual MongoDB URI from Step 4):
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/your-db-name?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
3. Save the file.

**Important Note:** `.env.local` is gitignored, so it's not committed to version control. Never share your URI publicly.

**For Beginners:** Environment variables keep secrets out of code. Next.js loads them automatically.

## Step 4: Configure MongoDB
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new cluster:
   - Click "Build a Database" > Free tier > Create.
   - Choose a provider (e.g., AWS) and region.
3. Set up access:
   - Under "Database Access," create a new database user (username/password).
   - Under "Network Access," add your IP (0.0.0.0/0 for anywhere, but restrict in production).
4. Get the connection string:
   - Under "Clusters," click "Connect" > "Drivers" > Copy the URI.
   - Replace `<password>` with your user's password.
   - Add database name if needed (e.g., `nexenbasics`).
5. Paste into `.env.local` as `MONGODB_URI`.

**Test Connection:** The project uses `src/lib/mongoDB.ts` to connect. If issues, check the file's comments.

**Alternative for Local Dev:** Install MongoDB locally via [MongoDB Community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community), run `mongod`, and use `mongodb://localhost:27017/nexenbasics`.

## Step 5: Run the Development Server
1. In the terminal (project root):
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   - This starts the Next.js server on http://localhost:3000.
   - You'll see output like "Local: http://localhost:3000" and "Ready in xxxms".

**What this does:** The dev server watches for file changes and auto-reloads the browser.

**Other Scripts:**
- `npm run build`: Builds for production.
- `npm start`: Runs the built app.
- `npm run lint`: Checks code quality.

## Step 6: Test the Application
1. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
2. You should see the home page.
3. Test auth: Go to `/register`, create a user, then `/login`.
4. Go to `/todos` (after login) to see the ToDo list.
5. Create a todo to verify database connection.

**Success Indicators:**
- No errors in terminal.
- Pages load without crashes.
- Todos save/retrieve from DB.

## Troubleshooting
- **"Module not found" Error:** Run `npm install` again.
- **MongoDB Connection Failed:** Check URI in `.env.local`, ensure Atlas IP access, verify credentials.
- **Port 3000 in Use:** Kill process or run `npm run dev -- -p 3001`.
- **TypeScript Errors:** Run `npm run lint` or check `tsconfig.json`.
- **Windows Path Issues:** Use forward slashes in paths.
- **Slow Install:** Use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if peer dep warnings.
- **No Styles:** Ensure Tailwind is installed (via shadcn/ui).

If stuck, check console (F12 in browser) or server terminal for errors. Search Stack Overflow with the error message.

**Pro Tip:** Use VS Code's integrated terminal (Ctrl+` ) for easier navigation.

## Tips for Beginners
- **Understand Commands:** `npm` is like "install this package." Read `package.json` scripts section.
- **File Structure:** See [README.md](../README.md#project-structure) for explanations.
- **Debugging:** Add `console.log('Debug message')` in code and check terminal/browser console.
- **Version Control:** After setup, run `git add . && git commit -m "Initial setup"`.
- **Learning Resources:** Watch "Next.js Crash Course" on YouTube.
- **Backup:** Copy `.env.local` securely before deleting.
- **Updates:** To update dependencies: `npm update`.
